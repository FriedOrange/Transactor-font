# Transactor fonts

Dot-matrix style fonts, using the patterns from the Commodore CBM/PET character generator ROM. The glyphs have a raster line effect, emulating a monochrome CRT display. Both regular (black on white) and inverse (white on black; reversed, in Commodore parlance) styles are available.

This project was hurriedly hacked together based on another font of mine, [Quantum](https://github.com/FriedOrange/Quantum-font); see that repo for technical details.

The PETSCII characters use the same Unicode encodings as [Rebecca Bettencourt's Pet Me fonts](https://www.kreativekorp.com/charset/map/petscii/).
